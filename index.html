    <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application for customers phones that can be connected to their Reverse Osmosis Systems. This device will give our customers 
    the ability to see into their Reverse Osmosis or Filtration Systems via electronical connections which will communicate to the application. These connections will allow our
    customers to remotely monitor multiple aspects of their system (i.e. gallons of water usage, leak detection, TDS and mineral levels, etc.).</p>

<p>In the current Water Quality Market there are no mobile applications with all of these different monitoring aspects for Filtration Systems. Other Water Quality Companies do
    have one portion or another but not all. Three items for monitoring stand out as large attractions for our customers and new customers. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Gallons of Water Usage, when it is time to change filters based on water usage and not time based.</li>
    <li>Leak detection, a customer is away on vacation and receives an alert on their mobile application telling them they have a leak on their Filtration System.  This allows them 
        to contact a friend, or family member and have the water shut off before it becomes a big problem.</li>
    <li>TDS Levels, there are many customers that will take their water to other locations to have their water tested since we do not have Quality Assurance in all states. If those
        customers take their samples to our competitors we know they are pitching them on a new system from them. We always risk loosing customers.</li>

<div class="media">
    <p>This application will need to be integrated into the ecommerce platform used by the residential ecommerce store (Shopify). The integration
            will allow for customers to automatically re-order filters upon notification of 20,000 Gallons Water Usage with a required "Quick Re-Order Option"
            for the customer. This application is not to integrate with the ERP.</p>

<div class="media">
    <ol>
<li>There is currently a one directional communication database being used to store data from commercial customers at this time.
    This current technology our engineers believe can be used and re-engineered for our residential Filtration Systems to feedback
    the information necessary for the monitoring.</li>
<li>The mobile application will receive notifications electronic detectors located in key positions on our Water Filtration Devices. The information
    received back will need to be transmitted via the mobile application to our customers.</li>
<li>The key identifiers for each individual customer will be the Serial number of their product (registered) and their user/pass for the
    website.</li>     
<li>Integration with Shopify will also require a data upload either nightly or in consistent intervals to maintain records as well as for customer service/tech 
    supports ability to assist in customer needs more effectively.</li>

<h4 style="margin-left: 50px; color: #2EC915" />Prototype Phase</h4>
<p>Engineering to build a prototype using the identified locations and technology for monitoring and feeding back the informaiton. Once the prototype
    has been completed we will test the prototype to be assured the monitoring is accurate without the application.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 50px; color: #2EC915" />Application Phase</h4>    
<p>During the Prototype Phase the Mobile Application Developers will be working with both SME's to learn a better understanding of the needs an focus for this application. Once the
    prototype has been tested and working as expected, we will move on to the Application Phase where the Mobile Application Developers will identify and establish the connections between
    the prototype and the application. Once established Quality will test for accuracy</p>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 50px; color: #2EC915" />Development Phase</h4>
<p>During the Development Phase our Mobile Application Deleopers will begin the process of buildinng the application.  Both Frontend and Backend developement will be taking place in order to keep
    everything in line.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 50px; color: #2EC915" />Quality Assurance</h4>
<p>Throughout this entire process there will be testing, not just at the end of each phose. This will keep the project on track all assist the team in hitting our deadline.</p>
<h4 style="margin-left: 50px; color: #2EC915" />Estimated Delivery Timeframe</h2>
<p>The current expectation of the team is to be ready for final testing in 6 months. Legal is prepared to begin patent submissions based upon the initial engineering phase unless there are 
    any unexpected issues.</p>

<p>Our project hinges on being able to utilize / re-design the current one-directional structure the commmercial division is using. If this turns out to be a non viable solution
